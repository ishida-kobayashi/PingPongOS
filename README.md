# PingPongOS
This repository contains my own implementation of the PingPongOS, a operating system initially proposed by Prof. Carlos A. Maziero. for his classes at UFPR. I aim to present a simple, but effective implementation to inspire other people when trying to work on their own versions for the same OS.
